Set up HEPfit package on NetBeans
==================================

To build developer version of HEPfit on NetBeans, first install all the dependencies for x86_64 architecture:

1. GSL
2. ROOT
3. BOOST
4. BAT


BAT installation for HEPfit
============================

==> Download the tarball from: https://github.com/bat/bat/releases/download/v1.0.0/BAT-1.0.0.tar.gz

$ curl -O https://github.com/bat/bat/releases/download/v1.0.0/BAT-1.0.0.tar.gz

==> gunzip and/or untar the source file by

$ tar -xf *.tar.gz
$ cd BAT-1.0.0

==> copy files in BATv1.0-dev/src-dev (from HEPfit directory) to BAT-1.0.0/src

$ cp -aiv ~/HEPfit/BATv1.0.0-dev/src-dev/* src

Next, run the "./configure" script by performing cross-compile for x86_64 arch.

After successfully install BAT in the BAT-1.0.0 directory, we have to symlink with the HEPfit directory. 

Note:

1. Default HEPfit directory where the NetBeans project navigate. 

Create a BAT directory in the HEPfit directory:

$ mkdir ~/HEPfit/BAT
$ cd ~/HEPfit/BAT

and symlink 'lib', 'bin', 'include' directory within the BAT installation directory (~/BAT-1.0.0/) by the following command:
 
$ ln -is ~/BAT-1.0.0/lib .
$ ln -is ~/BAT-1.0.0/bin .
$ ln -is ~/BAT-1.0.0/include .



BAT-parallel installation for HEPfit
=====================================

Create a separate directory for BAT parallel installation

$ mkdir BAT_parallel
$ cd BAT_parallel

==> Download the tarball from: https://github.com/bat/bat/releases/download/v1.0.0/BAT-1.0.0.tar.gz

$ curl -O https://github.com/bat/bat/releases/download/v1.0.0/BAT-1.0.0.tar.gz

==> gunzip and/or untar the source file by

$ tar -xf *.tar.gz
$ cd BAT-1.0.0

==> Make sure that pwd is: ~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/

==> copy files in BATv1.0.0_parallel-dev/src-dev (from HEPfit directory) to BAT-1.0.0/src

$ cp -aiv ~/HEPfit/BATv1.0.0_parallel-dev/src-dev/* src

==> copy files in BATv1.0.0_parallel-dev/BAT-dev (from HEPfit directory) to BAT-1.0.0/BAT

$ cp -aiv ~/HEPfit/BATv1.0.0_parallel-dev/BAT-dev/* BAT

Next, run the "./configure" script by performing cross-compile for x86_64 arch.

After successfully install BAT-parallel in the ~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/ directory, we have to symlink with the HEPfit directory. 

Note:

1. Default HEPfit directory where the NetBeans project navigate. 

Create a BAT_parallel directory in the HEPfit directory:

$ mkdir ~/HEPfit/BAT_parallel
$ cd ~/HEPfit/BAT_parallel

and symlink 'lib', 'bin', 'include' directory within the BAT_parallel installation directory (~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/) by the following command:
 
$ ln -is ~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/lib .
$ ln -is ~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/bin .
$ ln -is ~/BAT_parallel/BAT-1.0.0/include .

$ ls -ltrh



Remarks:
========

Here we install BAT and BAT-parallel for x86 arch and properly symlink with the HEPfit directory for successfully building the project on NetBeans.
