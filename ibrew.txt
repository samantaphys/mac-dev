Installation of Homebrew on MAC
================================

There are two types of architecture in MAC:

1. x86 architecture (intel processor)

2. ARM architecture (M1 or M2 processor)

Note: the package managers such as Homebrew on both architectures are different.

Usually Homebrew installed in ARM mode on ARM architecture and in x86 mode on x86 architecture.


Installation of ARM brew on ARM-MAC
====================================

Run the command to install Homebrew in an ARM shell:

$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

After that run the two command:

$ (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> {$HomePath}.zprofile

$ eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" 

In order to set ARM-MAC for x86 development using Homebrew, we have to first install Homebrew in an x86 mode that means running command must be in an x86 shell instead of ARM shell.  

Installation of x86 brew on ARM-MAC
====================================

$ arch -x86_64 zsh   #set the zsh shell to x86 mode

Run the command to install Homebrew in an x86 shell:

$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"  #install brew in an x86 shell

After that run the two command:

$ (echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> {$HomePath}.zprofile

$ eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)" 

Brew installed successfully! Now you are in x86 shell and install x86 packages as usual:

$ arch -x86_64 brew install <packages> 
or $ arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install <packages> 

Note: x86 brew install packages into /usr/local/bin instead of /opt/homebrew/bin

If you run:

$ brew install <packages> 

then both version (x86 and arm) of packages installed in their specified directions.

You might get the following error:

Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local

To create a symlink, run the command:

$ sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/bin /usr/local/Cellar  #It requires user password

All done!

Remarks:
========

You can install any Homebrew formula using the above steps in both x86 architecture and ARM architecture. Installation path for x86 is /usr/local 
and for ARM is /opt/homebrew
